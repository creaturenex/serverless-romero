## About Me
Former biopharma engineer transitioning into tech. I am currently enrolled online at LaunchSchool.com full-time to learn full-stack fundamentals. I really enjoy the intersection of software and hardware. I consider myself a maker and have messed with all sorts of stuff like building a pc/hackentosh, arduino, raspberry pi, LEDs, 3D printers. Honestly I just like having fun making and breaking things :)
